# More Information

## Technical Background

Hi! My name is Deanna Tran, and I'm a student in the College of Arts and Sciences  at NYU. As a Computer Science major, I have
worked with Python, Java, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and W3.CSS.

Also, I have used various product management tools like Slack, Trello, Asana, and different apps in the Google Suite.


## Passions Outside of School

### Art, Art, Art!

I love art in its various forms- from classical paintings to the newest music video.

### Film

I watch an obscene amount of independent films during the winter and Spring breaks, and if I had unlimited resources,
I would watch a movie every week at the IFC.
