This week, my team members and I became the official co-founders of an operational Tabi-Clock, the analog clock browser
extension you didn't know you needed.

Creating Tabi-Clock was a rewarding, and sometimes frustrating endeavor as I am not as familiar with javascript as
I would like to be. However, I am very happy with our final product, and I really enjoyed working with my team members.

I felt that each member of my team contributed to the code and overall aesthetic of the browser extension, and the resulting product was 1000x better that it would've been had I worked on it alone.

### Teamwork Process
My team and I worked remotely on this project; we did not have time to meet outside of class. Although this caused some slight issues when one of us needed help debugging, we were ultimately able to communicate well through Facebook Messenger.

In regards to design decisions, we all trusted each other's sense of minimalistic aesthetic. My team members both have backgrounds in film, and I knew they would make great design choices. I was focused mainly on the coding
aspect of the extension, but fortunately, Will and Andrea helped make the product look great for our demonstration!
