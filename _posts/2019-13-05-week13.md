This week, my group and I continued to work on the recursive lesson in freeCodeCamp. One of the moderators, RandellDawson, submitted a demo for the lesson to help our group make it clearer. I responded to RandellDawson's suggestions with my own suggestions about the explanations on recursion. I also came up with an example and commented about it in the pull request.
