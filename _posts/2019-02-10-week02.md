title: Week 2
---
This week, I continued to work on Team 2's browser extension, Tabi-clock, by modifying the beastify extension files from MDN.
By reading through the comments in these files, I was able to partially understand parts of the code, and updated it to fit our desired functionality.
As a result, I was able to figure out how to clear the browser through the extension popup button.

However, our desired result should not need the popup button. The extension should work automatically when a new tab is opened.

By the end of this week, I hope that my team and I will have at least reached this milestone. I am currently working on this issue, but so far, I have been unsuccessful.

I do not think we will have a working product by the due date, as we are struggling to make the javascript work properly.

#### Update! (2/11)
My team and I have successfull created a working prototype of the extension. I was able to make it start upon the opening of a new tab by looking at the github repositories of other Mozilla add-ons. My teammates, Andrea and Will did a wonderful job with the styling of the extension!

### Git and Github Lessons

During our class Git workflow assignment, I learned a lot about collaborating with others through git. For an example, before this assignment, I had not
exstensively used pull requests, and I had never accepted one myself. I now feel much less confused about the contribution process.
