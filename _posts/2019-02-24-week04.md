The Open Source project I hope to contribute to is called freeCodeCamp which was created and is actively
maintained by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). freeCodeCamp.org is an online resource and
community that helps those interested learn to code for free. Their curriculum is mainly focused on Web-Based
knowledge and languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), however, a recent update has added more focus on algorithms and
various javascript libraries.

The freeCodeCamp project under freeCodeCamp.org is their open source codebase and curriculum.

I am interested in contributing to this project because I completed freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification,
and I greatly enjoyed their material. Also, I was in the middle of completing the certification when they migrated to their new
curriculum, and I remember noticing a lot of different issues with the new practice problems.
