In regards to my group project, freeCodeCamp, I am still working on completing an issue I started working on before the group project began. I have fixed the majority of the problems related to the issue, but there seems to be additional problems with the code.

Next week, I hope to complete this issue, and start working on an issue with my team.


## Wikipedia

I think Wikipedia contributors are extremely diverse. I imagine that they are simply people who like to have their ideas heard.

I think I will one day contribute to Wikipedia regularly.

To pick the articles I will contribute to, I plan to start searching topics that I feel knowledgable about. Hopefully, some of these topics will have incomplete and editable Wikipedia pages.
