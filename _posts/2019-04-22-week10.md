I think the Wikipedia entry on inner source software development was interesting because it highlighted a lot of benefits of this practice that I didn't know. However, I feel that it should also have a section dedicated to the possible cons on inner source software development and the history of how the open source philosophy bleed into the hyper-private corporate world.

During Kevin Fleming's talk, I was extremely surprised by the amount of data Bloomberg can receive in such a small period of time. 100 billion messages in a few seconds is too large of an amount to imagine. In addition, I was very surprised that Bloomberg also takes steps to improve the open source technologies that it uses. However, I wish there was more time for Kevin Fleming to comment on the idea that in some way, by privatizing and commercializing open source technologies, they are not truly embracing the open source philosophy.

## Team Project

This week for the team project, I created a solution for FreeCodeCamp's quick sort algorithm. This gave me a chance to review my sorting algorithms, and it also more deeply familiarized me with the platform.

Next week, I plan to work on contributing to lessons and challenges about recursion.
