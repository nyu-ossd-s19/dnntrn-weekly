This week, for my group project, I debugged some of the challenges we have been working on for freeCodeCamp. Specifically, I worked on the challenge for quick sort, and my group and I eventually were able to test our contribution and submit another pull request.

Additionally, this weekend, I was a mentor at FlawlessHacks where I was able to help other students with their projects. I also attended various workshops, and I was able to work on a tech-focused zine. The topic of my zine was "Getting Involved in Open Source".
