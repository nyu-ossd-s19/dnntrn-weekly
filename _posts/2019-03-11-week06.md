I think most people would agree that Humanitarian Open Source Software created and used in an efficient manner is good for society. However, I feel that many social good focused projects fail to achieve this ideal level of impact due to disorganization and lack of resources. In this way, while Humanitarian Open Source projects are a great concept, they can sometimes be more difficult to join. This is due to the scale of the problems some of these projects are trying to address and the inherent difficulty of organizing unpaid workers toward a shared goal, in sometimes very urgent situations.

In regards to the prestige of HOSS, I think most of these projects do hold less prestige than their non-humanitarian counterparts. However, this is untrue for larger, more well know projects that are tackling more complex humanitarian issues. IO personally would love to be involved in HOSS, as long as the community is responsive and beginner-friendly.
